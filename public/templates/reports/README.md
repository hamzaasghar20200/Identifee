# Reports

This directory has been structured in the following:

```txt
/public/templates/reports
├── banks
│   └── <BANK NAME>
└── types
    └── TREASURY
```

The intent for this structure is to provide some categorization for the images and css that may become dynamic in the future as we add more report types and banks. By having a general purpose `types` folder that holds default image logos and css styling, we should be able to create a report for any proposed bank.
